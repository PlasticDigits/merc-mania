## Content Creation Guidelines

### For AI Content Generation

1. **Environment**: Always include environmental challenges (heat, dust, isolation)
2. **Stakes**: Every operation has financial and territorial implications
3. **Technology**: Modern military equipment in harsh conditions
4. **Economics**: Resources drive all decision-making
5. **Competition**: Multiple mercenary companies compete for the same targets
6. **Professionalism**: Mercenaries are skilled professionals, not random fighters

### Visual Asset Direction

- Weathered military equipment adapted for desert operations
- Mining facilities that look functional but temporary
- Mercenary camps that can be relocated quickly
- Resource stockpiles that represent real wealth and power
- Maps showing contested territories and strategic positions

### Audio/SFX Suggestions

- Industrial mining sounds (drilling, machinery, processing)
- Military radio chatter with operational terminology
- Desert wind and environmental ambiance
- Heavy equipment movement and deployment
- Combat sounds that emphasize tactical engagement

## Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract Naming

- Use military/corporate terminology for function names
- Resource operations should sound like business transactions
- Combat mechanics should feel like tactical deployments
- Economic systems should reflect real-world resource trading

### User Interface Language

- Replace "tokens" with "assets" or "resources"
- Frame "burning" as "operational costs" or "equipment loss"
- Present "mining" as "extraction operations"
- Describe "battles" as "territorial disputes" or "asset acquisition"
